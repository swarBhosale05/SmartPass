## 📜Description 


**SmartPass** is an Android application developed using Kotlin to facilitate managing and generating digital bus passes easier. It ensures quick and easy access when needed by allowing users to create and store passes for PMC, PCMC, and PMPML services with simplicity. The application, which has a user-friendly interface for entering required data, provides a seamless, ecofriendly alternative for traditional passes. Passes can be obtained immediately, along with a QR code that allows ticket checkers to digitally and quickly verify them.


## 📱 Features

- **Easy Pass Generation**: Users can create a digital pass by entering essential details like:
  - **Picture**
  - **Name**
  - **Phone Number**
  - **ID Card's Last 4 Digits**
  - **Gender**
  - **Age**
  - **Pass Type**: Choose from PMC, PCMC, or both.

- **Instant Pass Display**: After generating a pass, users can easily retrieve it by entering the last 4 digits of their ID card or their phone number. The pass details, including the QR code, will be displayed.

- **Verification**: The generated pass contains a QR code that can be scanned using a companion app designed for Ticket Checkers. This ensures secure and quick verification of the pass.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Generate Pass**: 
   - Fill in the required information.
   - Click on "Generate Pass" to create your digital pass.

2. **View Pass**:
   - On the "Display Pass" screen, enter the last 4 digits of your ID card or your phone number.
   - The pass information will be displayed along with a QR code.

3. **QR Code Scanning**:
   - The QR code can be scanned using the Ticket Checker’s app for verification.
