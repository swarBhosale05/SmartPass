## ðŸ“œDescription 


**SmartPass** is an Android application developed using Kotlin to facilitate managing and generating digital bus passes easier. It ensures quick and easy access when needed by allowing users to create and store passes for PMC, PCMC, and PMPML services with simplicity. The application, which has a user-friendly interface for entering required data, provides a seamless, ecofriendlyÂ alternative for traditional passes. Passes can be obtained immediately, along with a QR code that allows ticket checkersÂ to digitally and quicklyÂ verify them.


## ðŸ“± Features

- **Easy Pass Generation**: Users can create a digital pass by entering essential details like:
  - **Picture**
  - **Name**
  - **Phone Number**
  - **ID Card's Last 4 Digits**
  - **Gender**
  - **Age**
  - **Pass Type**: Choose from PMC, PCMC, or both.

- **Instant Pass Display**: After generating a pass, users can easily retrieve it by entering the last 4 digits of their ID card or their phone number. The pass details, including the QR code, will be displayed.

- **Verification**: The generated pass contains a QR code that can be scanned using a companion app designed for Ticket Checkers. This ensures secure and quick verification of the pass.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

   - Fill in the required information.
